        <div class='rtxt'>No. You will be able to use object-based tools. <br />
 <br />
The good news is you will no longer be breaking your objects' encapsulation. <br />

        <div class='txt'>To let SQL programmers giving up their living is not an easy task. But I know a professional concert piano player is doing programming for a living now. So it's not at all impossible. But you have to do a lot of preaching to connect people's own thinking process with new tools.<br />
<br />

Asking the "dumb question": can you point us (the unwashed sql folks) at some references for object-based tools?&nbsp; or briefly describe them, enough so we get the "aha-moment" of enlightenment.&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

I have an open-source Swing-based <a href='ObjectInspector.html'>ObjectInspector</a> that I modified from something Axel Uhl wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's kind of like a Smalltalk inspector.&nbsp; I added a <a href='BeanShell.html'>BeanShell</a> command window so one could dynamically run methods against the object you are looking at.&nbsp; I have some things I want to improve on it, but it will run OK now.&nbsp; Feel free to ask me for it.<br />

http://www.sabertooth.org/ (http://sabertooth.blogspot.com/) - seems to plan something like that ?<br />
<br />
Has anybody got an "object inspector" that can query (with ad-hoc written queries) millions of objects, as SQL tools can do on SQL databases?<br />
<br />
See: <a href='HowDoIQueryMyObjects.html'>HowDoIQueryMyObjects</a>?<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, I already read "How Do I Query My Objects", and I'm still worried about the whole ad-hoc query thing.&nbsp; Here's my understanding: there *is* currently no good tool for querying large object graphs like this, especially remotely.&nbsp; Think about this: your client (who could be on the other side of the world) says he gets an error everytime your system tries to render order #12345.&nbsp; What do you do?&nbsp; Fortunately, this is a temporary weakness (because people will write tools to support remote access to large object graphs, etc.), but for the moment, this will prevent me from using the system.&nbsp; I also think of the development stage of an application, when I want to run a single transaction, then check the data to see if it did what I wanted.&nbsp; Am I stuck with dumping the objects' details to System.out?<br />

I've implemented ad-hoc queries pretty easily using <a href='JXPath.html'>JXPath</a>, you should try out the <a href='JXPathDemo.html'>JXPathDemo</a>. In your user-on-the-phone-is-complaining example, you could easily take a look at your logs (you use a logging&nbsp; facility, don't you?) and see what's happening, or turn debugging on, set some breakpoints and navigate through the object graph using the debugger's expression evaluator. Pretty simple and efficient, but it could get a lot more sophisticated with specialized tools. -- <a href='CarlosVillela.html'>CarlosVillela</a></div>
