        <div class='rtxt'>The Avalon project is an effort to create, design, develop and maintain a common framework and set of components for applications written using the Java language. This framework is not a standalone product, but allows existing and yet to be created applications to fit into a common platform and to share code, design and human resources. <br />

Phoenix is a micro-kernel designed and implemented on top of the Avalon framework. It is both an API to program to and a reference implementation. The reference implementation provides a number of facilities to manage the environment of Server Applications. Such facilities include log management, classloading, thread management and security. In the future it will conditionally offer support extra facilities such as central server management, server pools, and other facilities aimed at reducing the time to market. The API defines a standard method of piecing togther server components and creating a server. <br />

Patterns: IoC and SoC are the main patterns. <br />
