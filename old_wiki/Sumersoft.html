We developed a software using Preveyler with the <a href='PucPr.html'>PucPr</a> team. That software was developed for one big EMS company, and it will run over the world plants of that company. The software was already deployed in Brazil since february and it will probably be deployed in the others plants over the world this year.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

What is EMS?&nbsp; <br />
EMS means Electronics Manufacturing Services.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; <br />
<b>"The Electronic Manufacturing Services sector is currently one of the world&#146;s most dynamic industries. With an average growth of 25% per year, the EMS industry is very attractive for investors. Technology Forecasters, an independent analyst estimated the EMS Industry at $73.2 billion in 1999 with a forecast of $149.4 billion for 2003. Bearn, Stearns &amp; Co Inc. estimates the total available market at $500 billion, meaning that only 15% is outsourced at this time."</b> <br />
