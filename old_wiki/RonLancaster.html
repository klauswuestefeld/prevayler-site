        <div class='txt'>Hi Ron, please tell us a bit about yourself.&nbsp; @:)<br />
<br />
Ron Lancaster a.k.a. nyven is an experienced programmer and software development manager with a Masters of Science in Software Engineering and a B.A. in Business Administration.<br />
<br />
<a href='WidgetWeb.html'>WidgetWeb</a> is the first application written by Ron to use the <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a> engine. The original reason to use <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a> is that it was extremely fast in the prototypes. However, after further use it quickly became evident that the lack of need for a data objects layer to manage translating method calls to SQL dramatically speeds development and greatly simplifies the architecture. The point is reduced development cost.</div>
