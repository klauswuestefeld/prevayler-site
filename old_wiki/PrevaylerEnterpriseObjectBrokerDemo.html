        <p><i>This is a rough rendering of a page from the old Prevayler wiki. Please see <a href='http://www.prevayler.org/'>the new wiki</a> for current documentation.</i></p>
        <div class='rtxt'><a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a> has NECESSARILY to provide a demo which is <a href='TheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyDemonstratePrevayler.html'>TheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyDemonstratePrevayler</a> -- <a href='KlausWuestefeld.html'>KlausWuestefeld</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

I'll strike you a deal -&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
 # you change org.prevayler.demo into org.prevayler.demos.demo2&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
 # I write the simpler demo as demo1&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
 # we change the bank demo to interface/impl separated with factories.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

Cool.&nbsp; @8) -- <a href='KlausWuestefeld.html'>KlausWuestefeld</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

EOB cannot work with callbacks. No one likes polling, though. Doesn't EOB plan to support callbacks? -- <a href='KlausWuestefeld.html'>KlausWuestefeld</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
See the <a href='EOBCallbackSupport.html'>EOBCallbackSupport</a> plan.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
The problem is that for a servlet example you would never setup a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
listener because it does not suit the medium. Maybe a servlet use of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
same bank demo comes later (for us or for you). See fake idea-callback of Klaus's below -- <a href='PaulHammant.html'>PaulHammant</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
The problem is not the <a href='BusinessClasses.html'>BusinessClasses</a> providing for a listener and the servlet not using it. The problem would be the GUI trying to be a listener if there were no support for that in the <a href='BusinessClasses.html'>BusinessClasses</a>. -- <a href='KlausWuestefeld.html'>KlausWuestefeld</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
I was hoping that it could be switchable via the contructor for the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Swing GUI. From your point of view, given that the gui and the object&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
model are tied to each other now, the only time the GUI gets a callback&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
is when the GUI has done an update on the account.&nbsp; I am not saying get&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
rid of it of course, just become dual mode. -- <a href='PaulHammant.html'>PaulHammant</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Since we are doing <a href='InterfaceImplementationSeparation.html'>InterfaceImplementationSeparation</a>, why don't we put it to some use? @;)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
The interface used by the GUI can be exactly the same: with the listener. We can provide the GUI with a "fake" implementation, though, that can delegate everything to a "real" implementation and do the polling occasionally to notify its listeners.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
We would therefore have two bank demos:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
 #The interface/impl separated local one, which doesn't even know about EOB; and&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
 #The EOB distributed one, which <i>imports</i> the local one but preserves its interfaces and impls exactly as they are.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
This would also be cool to demonstrate that EOB is not an intrusive thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<a href='KlausWuestefeld.html'>KlausWuestefeld</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
I like the idea of the fake callback (that adapts the poller to callback on the client side), but cannot see why they do not have a common codebase. -- <a href='PaulHammant.html'>PaulHammant</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
I was thinking they DO HAVE the same codebase. When I say "the remote <i>imports</i> the local" I really mean <i>"imports"</i> and not "copies and pastes". Are we agreeing? (If we are, I shall refrase the above "...but preserves its interfaces and impls exactly as they are" which I agree is misleading) -- <a href='KlausWuestefeld.html'>KlausWuestefeld</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
If we pass the Bank (interface now not impl) into the constructor of the GUI (not the case now), then we are illustrating the ultimate unintrusive thing. -- <a href='PaulHammant.html'>PaulHammant</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Yes. That is what I had in mind, or else we would not have proper interface/impl separation. -- <a href='KlausWuestefeld.html'>KlausWuestefeld</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
The code in prevayler <a href='CVS.html'>CVS</a> is all local.&nbsp; In EOB <a href='CVS.html'>CVS</a>, we reimpl the Bank interface to 1) have the fake callback and 2) make it remote.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Could not be more <i>un</i>intrusive? -- <a href='PaulHammant.html'>PaulHammant</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
I like the idea of having the local demo in <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a> <a href='CVS.html'>CVS</a> and the remote in <a href='EOB.html'>EOB</a> <a href='CVS.html'>CVS</a>. Let's do the following, then: You do <a href='TheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyDemonstratePrevayler.html'>TheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyDemonstratePrevayler</a>, I do the interface/impl separation and you do the EOB remote demo. OK? -- <a href='KlausWuestefeld.html'>KlausWuestefeld</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Agreed.&nbsp; Lets do it.&nbsp; My SF is is paul-h, I promise not to make a mess.&nbsp; You'll need to rename the demo package to demos/demo1 or demos/demo2 (if new demo is simpler) --<a href='PaulHammant.html'>PaulHammant</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
