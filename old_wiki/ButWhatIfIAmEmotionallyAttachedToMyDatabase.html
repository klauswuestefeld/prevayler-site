        <p><i>This is a rough rendering of a page from the old Prevayler wiki. Please see <a href='http://www.prevayler.org/'>the new wiki</a> for current documentation.</i></p>
        <div class='rtxt'>For most applications, prevalence is a much Simpler, much Faster and much Cheaper way of preserving your objects for future generations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Of course, there will be all sorts of excuses to hang on to "ye olde database", but at least now there is an option.<br />

        <div class='txt'><hr />
Apart from cost, how is <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a> different to TimesTen?<br />
<br />
<a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a> is orders of magnitude simpler and less error-prone, therefore. <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a> provides transparent persistence for your business objects while TimesTen provides you a JDBC interface.<br />
<br />

But what if I am emotionally or physically detached from Java?<br />

By 'excuses' I guess we mean stuff like "I have a terabyte and a half of data" (or even 5 Gigabytes) and "My entire business processes are based off of reports that run against the SQL database".<br />

Here are some more excuses:<br />
<br />
1) I am writing an application for public consumption, that may be deployed in situations where one is expected to be frugal with RAM, such as a personal computer or shared server.<br />
<br />
2) I am worried that an explosive growth in my service will out-strip my ability to purchase RAM, and cause me to have to rearchitect the application to use disk, in the process breaking all the performance assumptions I made when I first wrote it.<br />
<br />
These are not excuses. They're good reasons. If the proponents of <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a> were a little less inflammatory, this site wouldn't leave me with such a bad taste in my mouth. I came here this evening because I thought <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a> suited the application I was writing, but this site annoys me so much that the one thing it _does_ convince me, is that I want very little to do with the obvious zealots running the project.<br />
<br />
You don't need to be this hype-heavy to sell a good product. The corollory is left to the reader.</div>
