        <div class='txt'>Markus Menner is a 40 year old software architect (since over 20 years), developing primarily in Java. <br />
<br />
Currently he works on a framework for the development of full featured rich client applications, whose GUI's (Swing at the moment) are dynamically generated by conventional web app techniques like JSP's, servlets, PHP or whatever. <br />
<br />
The framework uses XML documents with special tags to describe the GUI, which are interpreted (on the client side) by a special display engine, which then produces the GUI. <br />
<br />
The framework takes care of and integrates every aspect of developing applications: the design of GUI's, the access to data stores, binding data to the GUI elements (with <a href='XPath.html'>XPath</a> expressions), generating XSL-FO reports and so on.<br />
<br />
He believes in the idea to replace databases by prevalent systems like <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a> and will integrate such a system in the framework he's working on. But a lot of work has to be done til then :-) ...<br />
