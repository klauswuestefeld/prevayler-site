        <h1>WidgetWeb</h1>
        <p><i>This is a rough rendering of a page from the old Prevayler wiki. Please see <a href='http://www.prevayler.org/'>the new wiki</a> for current documentation.</i></p>

<a href='WidgetWeb.html'>WidgetWeb</a>(TM) is a framework for creating community-shared websites similar to wikis. These are websites where content and page composition can be edited via a web browser. A powerful permission model is provided to restrict which community members are allowed to perform these edits.<br />
<br />
<a href='WidgetWeb.html'>WidgetWeb</a>(TM) is built on a simple premise: components comprise a web page and components can be nested to create more complicated effects. This provides for easy browser-based editing. Additionally, the powerful permission model allows the site administrator to let the community edit the content and the page layout. This is called community-shared editing (such as employees of a company, members of your family, etc.).<br />

Why <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a>:<br />
I originally had <a href='WidgetWeb.html'>WidgetWeb</a> using HSQLDB and then later switched to <a href='MySQL.html'>MySQL</a>. As of about two months ago, I switched to <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a>. So, why <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a>? Because it was fast! Later I learned that there are other reasons for using <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a> - besides blazing speed.<br />
