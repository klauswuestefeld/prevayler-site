        <div class='rtxt'>[From http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/]:<br />
<hr />
The <a href='JavaBeans.html'>JavaBeans</a> component architecture is the platform-neutral architecture for the Java application environment. It's the ideal choice for developing or assembling network-aware solutions for heterogeneous hardware and operating system environments--within the enterprise or across the Internet. In fact, it's the only component architecture you should consider if you're developing for the Java platform. <br />
<br />
The <a href='JavaBeans.html'>JavaBeans</a> component architecture extends "Write Once, Run Anywhere" capability to reusable component development. In fact, the <a href='JavaBeans.html'>JavaBeans</a> architecture takes interoperability a major step forward--your code runs on every OS and also within any application environment. A beans developer secures a future in the emerging network software market without losing customers that use proprietary platforms, because <a href='JavaBeans.html'>JavaBeans</a> components interoperate with Active X. <a href='JavaBeans.html'>JavaBeans</a> architecture connects via bridges into other component models such as ActiveX. Software components that use <a href='JavaBeans.html'>JavaBeans</a> APIs are thus portable to containers including Internet Explorer, Visual Basic, Microsoft Word, Lotus Notes, and others. <br />
<br />
The <a href='JavaBeans.html'>JavaBeans</a> specification defines a set of standard component software APIs for the Java platform. The specification was developed by Sun with a number of leading industry partners and was then refined based on broad general input from developers, customers, and end-users during a public review period. <br />
