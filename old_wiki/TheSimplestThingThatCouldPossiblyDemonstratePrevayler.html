That poses an inevitable challenge: What is the simplest thing? -- <a href='KlausWuestefeld.html'>KlausWuestefeld</a><br />
<br />
<hr />
<a href='Simpler.html'>Simpler</a> would be a tiny mainable demo that did some maths and persisted the interim results every n seconds.&nbsp; The user could ctrl-c it and start it again at the point it left off.&nbsp; The control logic could be less than 50 lines.&nbsp; Prime number calculation might be a neat demo. Something the developer understands (in terms of use) even if then do not understand the maths.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the bank demo is your advanced case.<br />

<br />
<br />
Two things I think are important for the demo:<br />
 #It must convey the notion of atomicity (the bank demo has that with the transfer command).<br />
 #Wether GUI or text-based, it must be interactive. This is a subtle issue, but performing calculations does not <b><i>REALLY</i></b> need persistence.<br />
<a href='KlausWuestefeld.html'>KlausWuestefeld</a><br />
<br />
I would agree that it does not need persistence, but it is the simplest case.&nbsp; From the newbies experience, something that has minimal code, but is restartable (not just at the prime where it left off, not where it was in its brute force iterative investigation) is best.&nbsp; Console interaction would IMHO merely detract from the simplicity.&nbsp; The newbie, should say <i>hey that is cool, on the the next demo ... Bank</i>&nbsp; --<a href='PaulHammant.html'>PaulHammant</a><br />

<br />
Prime numbers it will be. @:) <a href='KlausWuestefeld.html'>KlausWuestefeld</a><br />
