There needs to be some kind of quickstart tutorial. I have waded through the tutorials, and they're fine, but I want the bare minimum so that I can begin working. <br />
<br />
The problem that I am having is a null pointer exception at this line in my code:<br />
<br />
prev = new <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a>(new PrevaylerPersistence(),prevalenceBase);<br />
<br />
And then in the <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a> class, it is giving me an exception here:<br />
<br />
clock.resume();<br />
<br />
So I know it's related to my setup, but the demos are not close enough to what I need. I have had to strip out all of the non-essential GUI stuff / etc., and tried to build my app. But I seem to be missing something.<br />
<br />
This sort of quick question is better answered in the discussion <a href='MailingLists.html'>MailingLists</a>. Or else, you will have to stay polling this page. --<a href='KlausWuestefeld.html'>KlausWuestefeld</a><br />
<br />
So when is the new tutorial going to be available? Carlos said "I've wiped the tutorial away while I give it a complete rewrite." This has been up for at least one month. As I understand a new version of Pervayler is out, some updated documentation would be really nice.<br />
