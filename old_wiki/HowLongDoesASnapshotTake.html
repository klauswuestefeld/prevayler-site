        <div class='rtxt'>I have a large business app, using about 1.000.000 to 10.000.000 business objects. How much memory would I need? And how long would serializing this whole graph take? How long would a recovery take, given that &gt;1000 clients commit 60 database operations per minute each, 10 hours a day?<br />
<br />
The <a href='ScalabilityTest.html'>ScalabilityTest</a> requires 500MB RAM to run with 1.000.000 <a href='RecordObjects.html'>RecordObjects</a> stored in a HashMap. Recovery is in the order of 4000 commands per second on a 1GHz desktop PC. It would take 9 seconds, therefore, to re-apply your commandLog for a day. It takes 12 seconds to serialize 100.000 <a href='RecordObjects.html'>RecordObjects</a> stored in a HashMap and 21 seconds to read them back. -- <a href='KlausWuestefeld.html'>KlausWuestefeld</a> and <a href='CarlosVillela.html'>CarlosVillela</a></div>

<br />
So in other words, his 10M business objects would take 20 minutes to serialize and 40 minutes to load?&nbsp; That's not a happy answer.<br />
<br />
You gotta be kidding if you're planning to put 10M prevalent objects on a 1GHz desktop PC w/ an IDE drive. C'mon, you don't run Windows XP on a Pentium 100, and that's perfectly OK, then why stretch <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a> like that?<br />
