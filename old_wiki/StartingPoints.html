From the Java2 Standard Edition 1.4 datasheet: <br />
"64-bit support provides Java technology developers with near limitless amounts of memory for <i>high-performance, high-scalability</i> computing. While previous J2SE releases were limited to addressing 4 gigabytes of RAM, version 1.4 allows Java applications to access <i>hundreds of gigabytes</i> of RAM. [On 64bit architectures] This enables developers to drive more applications and very large datasets into memory, and avoids the performance overhead of reading data in from a disk or from a database." <br />

"After doing lots of tests we are now using <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a> in one of our production systems. <i>And Wow! this baby flies!</i><br />
<br />
I'm very pleased with the simplicity of design and the performance of <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a>.<br />
<br />
We've been using <a href='Oracle.html'>Oracle</a> and a persistence layer in our first project and it was _very_ painfull. Started the second marketplace with the same persistence layer and I got so fed up with it that I decided to change to <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a> in the middle of the project. Just like that. And I love it!"<br />

"Although I'm not using the prevayler code, I've come up with a very similar approach during design and development of a simple medical hardware application. The requirement was to keep a database of patient data consisting of personal data, test sessions and test results.<br />
<br />
It all ended up living in the RAM. Our average customer's office worth of data for this application fits comfortably (in text file form) on a 1.4MB diskette, so it was more than obvious not to have anything to do with files -- the whole database is read from the (hand-modifiable, if need be) text file on startup, and is then saved as a whole whenever the patient file is closed. A command log is in the works, and -- given the database's almost negligible size -- the command log will be the only and ultimate way of storing the database -- yup, without any kind of persistent snapshot.<br />
<br />
Internally, I ended up implementing quite a few concepts of object prevalence. Right now I'm cleaning up the client code/business command separation.<br />
<br />
Although I've got to know the prevayler project only as of today, I've managed to implement almost the same thing. It took me almost half a year of deep thinking about how to do that, I admit. Nicely enough, the database was the last thing to be done in that partiular app. Given enough thought, the prevalent objects idea -- to me -- seems the only clean-cut way to manage data without having a dozen layers between your client, your business logic, and your data. It's a 13k line C++ application (using Qt) that manages its data in an <a href='ACID.html'>ACID</a> clean way, talks to the hardware (about 35% of the code is the hardware interfacing code), and provides a user interface for all that. Doing it 'the obvious way' would require at least bundling a hefty embedded database library, or using <a href='MySQL.html'>MySQL</a> for simplicity's sake. After some conservative estimates I come to the conclusion that object persistence interfacing to an SQL data storage thing (<a href='RDBMS.html'>RDBMS</a>, whatever) would take more time to cleanly implement and debug, than just going with the object prevalence. I even went as far to give GigaBase a test run for about two week. Even though it was much easier to use than your typical parsed query based system, it still looked very hackish.<br />
<br />
All in all, it's a neat concept, it has allowed me to keep the code clean and extremely simple (even in C++ with Qt), and is something that should be taught in computer science database courses, on par with classic <a href='RDBMS.html'>RDBMS</a> theory and practice. I admit that, in fact, it may only be the lack of formal CS education on my part that gave me a clean-enough horizon to actually live happily (and without prejudice) with object prevalence."<br />

I think it was a mistake to not have the wiki be prevalent during the Slashdot inundation a few days ago.&nbsp; Everybody on Slashdot was making fun of how quickly your own server died.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yep, quite unfortunate. Everyone assumed that the site was being run by a prevalence engine. Which was an incorrect assumption to make.<br />
<br />
Oh well. a lot of people on slashdot are still attached to their database.<br />
<br />
64 bit cpu's and hopefully a serious decrease in ram costs will see most systems using some sort of prevalence engine</div>
