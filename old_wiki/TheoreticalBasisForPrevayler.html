        <div class='txt'>Has anyone written papers about <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a> or similar systems?<br />
<br />
When I saw prevayler for the first time last year, I immediately understood the idea, and wondered why I hadn't tried to do it. I've studied several OO methods (OMT, Fusion, Catalysis, Syntropy...) and noticed that a lot of the analysis/conceptual modelling techniques consist of:<br />
<br />
 * modelling what kinds of objects are allowed (class diagrams)<br />
 * modelling what objects and relationships exist at a particular time point (instance diagrams)<br />
 * modelling what sequence of "events" happen to the entire domain of discourse (and the subsequent series of instance diagrams representing their effect)<br />
<br />
I built formal models of these, but worried that I couldn't support concurrency and nondeterminism.<br />
If you take <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a> "commands" to be implementations of "global events" and consider the set of all objects being managed by prevayler to be implementations of a "domain of discourse" you'd find that you have an implementation of one of these analysis models. From what I can see, prevayler doesn't allow multiple commands to happen simultaneously and correctly implemented prevalent objects can't behave nondeterministically. Those are the major assumptions I made with my analysis models. I never thought people would find a good reason to live within these limitations @;) --<a href='DafyddRees.html'>DafyddRees</a><br />
<br />
Just a little correction, Dafydd, is that your Business Objects must act deterministically, and not your entire prevalent system -- that wouldn't even be possible if you are working with things such as IO or times and dates. I don't see it as a being a limitation that big, in fact it gets to be just good programming practice after some time. Why do you think "people would (not) find a good reason to live within these limitations"? -- <a href='CarlosVillela.html'>CarlosVillela</a><br />
<br />
I assume that all the business objects held in the prevalent system act deterministically - I don't make any assumptions about how this is implemented by a prevalent system. (By the way you can model and even implement time deterministically - in fact there's several ways to do it. The simplest one involves sending a "tick" event into the system in the stream of incoming events.)<br />

That "tick" approach is the one used in <a href='Prevayler.html'>Prevayler</a> 2.00.</div>
